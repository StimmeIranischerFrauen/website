## In Remembrance and Solidarity

We gather to honor the memory of the tens of thousands of innocent lives lost during the brutal crackdown on peaceful 
protests in Iran. The courage and sacrifice of those who stood for freedom, dignity, and human rights will never be 
forgotten. Reports suggest that tens of thousands of civilians were killed in an unprecedented wave of violence by state
security forces, a tragedy now etched into the history of Iran’s struggle for justice and liberty.

This memorial is dedicated to all the victims — mothers, fathers, young people, children, students, and activists — whose 
voices were silenced but whose spirit continues to inspire millions around the world.

As we mourn together, let us also reaffirm our commitment to truth, justice, and the universal right to life and freedom. 
May their memories be a beacon that guides us in the ongoing fight against oppression and towards a future where human 
dignity is upheld for all.

**Location:** In front of the Islamic Republic embassy, Thunstrasse 68, 3006 Bern

**Time:** 14:00 - 15:30
