    <h3>Global Day of Action (Munich, Germany)</h3>
    <p class="news-date">14 February 2026</p>
    <p>
    We will be in Munich on 14th of February 2026 in solidarity with Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution, a day to take to the streets and compel the international community to take urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people.<br/>
    Our six demands are:
        <ul>
          <li>Dismantle the regime's machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran</li>
          <li>Cut off the regime's financial lifelines in full</li>
          <li>Ensure free internet and communications for the people of Iran</li>
          <li>Expel the regime's "diplomats" and prosecute its criminals</li>
          <li>Immediate release of all political prisoners</li>
          <li>Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government to lead Iran toward democracy</li>
        </ul>
