**Stimme Iranischer Frauen (CH)** (Voices of Iranian Women – Switzerland) was founded in Basel in 2022 during the Woman, Life, Freedom movement. The association emerged in response to the widespread protests in Iran and the urgent need to amplify the voices of Iranian dissidents advocating for fundamental human rights and freedom from a totalitarian theocratic regime.

We are a non-profit, volunteer-based association committed to supporting Iranian civil society. Our mission is to raise international awareness of human rights violations in Iran and to advocate for meaningful political and legal action beyond symbolic statements. We work to ensure that the voices of Iranian women and dissidents are heard clearly within Switzerland and across Europe.

Stimme Iranischer Frauen (CH) collaborates closely with international NGOs, civil society organizations, and advocacy groups working on Iran-related issues, human rights, and women’s rights. Through these collaborations, we aim to strengthen transnational solidarity and coordinated action.

Our primary focus has been, and will continue to be, the decades-long struggle of Iranians for freedom, dignity, and justice. We dedicate our resources to supporting this movement through advocacy, public engagement, and political outreach.

We organize demonstrations, public discussions, and cultural and political events in Switzerland, and we contribute to the organization of major Iran-related events across Europe. We maintain close working relationships with local and regional politicians in Basel and are actively expanding our network at the national and European levels.

If you are interested in collaborating with us, or believe that we can support your work, we welcome you to get in touch.

Journalists in Switzerland and the European Union are also encouraged to contact us. As Iranian activists, we can provide context, background, and informed perspectives on developments within Iran and the broader human rights movement.
