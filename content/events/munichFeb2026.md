## Description 

A call by the transition leader of Lion-Sun Revolution, crown prince Reza Pahlavi:

Iranians abroad and freedom-loving people around the world,

February 14 is the Global Day of Action in solidarity with Iran’s Lion-and-Sun Revolution, a day to take to the streets and compel the international community to take urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people.

Our six demands are clear:

1. Dismantle the regime’s machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran
2. Cut off the regime’s financial lifelines in full
3. Ensure free internet and communications for the people of Iran
4. Expel the regime’s "diplomats" and prosecute its criminals
5. Immediate release of all political prisoners
6. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government to lead Iran toward democracy

Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto are the main gathering points. If you cannot travel, join protests in your own city and be the voice of Iran.

The Islamic Republic’s occupying rule has tried to break our nation’s will through massacre and brutal violence. It has failed. These invading terrorists, alien to Iran, have slaughtered tens of thousands of brave Iranians and cut off the internet to hide their crimes. Yet the people of Iran still stand before bullets, raising the cry of freedom and love of country. The era of fear is over. The era of freedom is near. Iranians have risen.

To those of you who believe in Iran’s freedom: on Saturday, February 14, rise in solidarity with the people of Iran. Your solidarity matters. When we stand united, governments are compelled to listen. History will remember those who stood with the Iranian people.

Long live freedom.
Long live Iran.
Victory to Iran’s Lion-and-Sun Revolution.
